# Wine Quality Predictor Using Support Vector Machine
Welcome to the Wine Quality Predictor project! This project aims to build a machine learning model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict the quality of wines based on various chemical properties. The dataset used for training and testing the model is the famous "Wine Quality" dataset.

### White Wine Dataset Variables

The White Wine dataset contains twelve variables:

1. **Fixed Acidity**: The amount of fixed acids in the wine, which contribute to its overall acidity.
2. **Volatile Acidity**: The amount of volatile acids in the wine, which can lead to an unpleasant vinegar-like taste.
3. **Citric Acid**: The amount of citric acid in the wine, which can add freshness and flavor.
4. **Residual Sugar**: The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation, which can affect the sweetness of the wine.
5. **Chlorides**: The amount of salts in the wine, which can impact the taste and texture.
6. **Free Sulfur Dioxide**: The amount of free sulfur dioxide in the wine, which acts as a preservative and antioxidant.
7. **Total Sulfur Dioxide**: The total amount of sulfur dioxide in the wine, including both free and bound forms.
8. **Density**: The density of the wine, which is related to the alcohol content and sugar concentration.
9. **pH**: The measure of acidity or basicity of the wine.
10. **Sulphates**: The amount of sulfates in the wine, which can contribute to its preservation and aroma.
11. **Alcohol**: The alcohol content of the wine.
12. **Quality**: The quality rating of the wine, typically on a scale from 1 to 10.

These variables provide important information about the chemical properties and characteristics of the white wine samples, which will be used to train the Support Vector Machine model for wine quality prediction.
